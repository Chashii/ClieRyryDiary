            <h1>1st Anniversary Letter!</h1>
            <h2>Hemwo bebiii!! Happy 1st anniversary to us! We have known each other for 1 year now and we have been together for 1 year now. All i want to say is thank you for everything that you did and done to me. I still can't believe that i have you in my life, it's been a year na. Throughout this year, we laughed, cried, had fun, had boring days, and faced many challenges. I am thankful that i am with you in all those situations. Mostly i am not with you in the majority of those situations and left you alone in important situations. I did hurt you a lot throughout this year too. I am still regretting everything, promising to myself and to you as well that i will change and will treat you better than ever. I don't want to make this letter a bit sad but i want to be transparent to you. There are a lot of things that i want to experience with you. I want to celebrate my achievements and accomplishments with you. There's a lot of things that i want to give and offer to you. I am very happy with you. Words can't describe how happy i am with you and how i love you. I will marry you someday. If i can today, i will HAHAHAHA. I am so proud of you mahal. Thank you for being with me and accepting me to your life. I will always be right by your side. I may not be the best at making you feel it but i am really there for you. I will never leave you. You will always have me in your life. I will always choose you no matter what i face, we face and how many challenges and situations we go through. I will not hesitate to choose you over and over again. Let's make more memories and celebrate countless monthsaries and anniversaries together.
